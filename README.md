# PakMerger
Merges any number of .Pak files including AssetRegistry.bin files.

Either drag and drop the .pak files directly onto the exe, or create a .txt file and list the paks one per line, then drag the .txt file onto the exe.

Paks are merged in alphabetical order by default (A<-B, A<-C, A<-D, etc), .txt files allow you to custom order the merging.
